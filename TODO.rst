- make it work for annotations / mongostuff too.
  involves changemessage and content_type problem. Maybe insert own contenttypes? Uh, oh.

- check for something set on the meta to start keeping history, or in the settings of the site.

- read about many-to-many...

- Methods to get the history of any object, with optional depth.
  
- Move al the helpers and utils to some other file.
